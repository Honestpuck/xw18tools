## XWorld 2018 Conference Presentation

### Talking To The JSS From Python

### compliance.py

A "real world" example from my day to day work.

#### examples.py

A tiny file with some examples. It isn't **really** meant to be run, just read as examples.

### sanitise.py

Another real world example. This is what I used to sanitise the JSS data so I could safely show it in my presentation if I wanted.

### target.py

An example Webhook target in Flask. It updates an extension attribute when
a computer joins or leaves a smart group.

### email.py

A _thin_ example Webhook. It is built to send an email when a computer joins
a smart group. It's missing the code to build the actual email text but
contains the logic and code to send it.

### XWorld2018.key
